# About

   AutoTest Framwork is an easy use automation framwork. Build with Python, it provides lots of features to support 
automating, so that anyone can build a automation framwork to test their app or sdk or framework without creating 
a new framework for testting.
   But now, I am stopping to coding the framework for a moment. Something is important than this in this stage. So I am focus on the base
knowelage study and get an new offer.
